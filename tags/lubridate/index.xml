      <description>Sometimes we have data with dates and/or times that we want to manipulate or summarize. A common example in the health sciences is time-in-study. A subject may enter a study on Feb 12, 2008 and exit on November 4, 2009. How many days was the person in the study? (Donâ€™t forget 2008 was a leap year; February had 29 days.) What was the median time-in-study for all subjects?
Another example are experiments that time participants performing an activity, applies a treatment to certain members, and then re-times the activity.</description>
